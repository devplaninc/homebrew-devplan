    <<~EOS
      Auto-update is disabled in this Homebrew build.

      To update devplan, use Homebrew:
        brew upgrade devplaninc/devplan/devplan

      The CLI's internal updater is not available for Homebrew installations.
      This ensures compatibility with Homebrew's package management system.
